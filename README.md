### 👋🏻 hey! i'm snehasish.

i'm a 17 y/o full-stack web developer from india, currently balancing high-school while actively managing my projects. i mostly use javascript/typescript (nodejs, nextjs, mongo-db). i am currently learning rust and only a beginner at python. my interests include football, animanga, music, physics and a a little astronomy. i spend my entire day either writing code, or doing everything except studying. i play football sometimes, but rarely watch any matches (except fifa). i love watching anime, reading manga and listening to music.

### 📂 work

i'm currently working on [@PastelNine](https://github.com/pastelnine) (previously known as "XTFZ") which i started back in `december 2022`. however i have restarted the entire project again, to work on it in a complete different way. i spend most of my time coding for PastelNine. and sometimes i go off-work to build other side-projects. i am also handling some social-media accounts, of my own, as side-projects. so few hours of the day i spend writing scripts and editing for those. i still did not start contributing to any open-source projects, but i am deciding to start and learn it real soon.

### 📈 experience

i've `3+ years` experience in building completely functional websites and web apps (`PWAs` too). i use `nextjs`, `reactjs` paired with `chakra-ui`, `shadcn-ui`, `material-ui` or `tailwind-css` for frontend, while for the backend, i rely on `nodejs (js/ts)` in conjunction with `expressjs` to develop robust webservers and RESTful APIs.

### 🌟 favs

some of my fav animes include attack on titan, banana fish, oshi no ko and hell's paradise. you can find my watchlist [here](https://aniwatchtv.to/community/user/3163264/watch-list). i also read mangas and manhwas. i love the blue lock colored manga and the solo leveling manhwa. you can always drop a suggestion for me.

i also enjoy music (any genre) but i mostly listen to pop (ind, jpop and kpop), indie and r&b. my fav artists include the weeknd, arijit singh and juice wrld. i also (scream, cry) to taylor swift's songs. my fav indie artists include the nbhd, the 1975, lana del rey and tv girl.
