### 👋🏻 hey! i'm snehasish.

i'm a 17 y/o 👦🏻 full-stack web developer 👨🏻‍💻 from india 🇮🇳, currently balancing high-school 🎒 while actively managing my projects 📂. i mostly use javascript/typescript (nodejs, nextjs, mongo-db). i am currently learning rust 🧡 and only a beginner at python 🐍.

my interests include football ⚽, animanga 💢, music 🎵, physics 🍎 and a a little astronomy 🌌. i spend my entire day either writing code 💻, or doing everything except studying ❌✍🏻. i play football sometimes ⚽, but rarely watch any matches 📺. i love watching anime 🥰, reading manga 📚 and listening to music 🎧.

### work 📂

i'm currently working on @xtfz which i started back in `december 2022`. however i have restarted the entire project again, to work on it in a complete different way.

i spend most of my time coding for XTFZ. and sometimes i go off-work to build other side-projects. i am also handling some social-media accounts, of my own, as side-projects. so few hours of the day i spend writing scripts and editing for those.
